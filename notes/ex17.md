#Exercise 17: Heap And Stack Memory Allocation

- Goal: To create a small program to manage a efficient database.

    - It would contain some knowledge to some file I/O

## Some quotes for the ex17

> ### allocating large data on the "heap"
> The whole point of this program is that I'm using malloc to ask the OS for a large amount of memory to work with when I create the Database.

- Null is 0 so boolean works
    
> In many of the checks I'm testing that a pointer is not NULL by simply doing `if(!ptr) die("fail!")` this is valid because `NULL` will evaluate to `false`. You could be explicit and say `if(ptr == NULL) die("fail!")` as well. On some rare systems `NULL` will be stored in the computer (represented) as something not `0`, but the C standard says you should still be able to write code as if it has a 0 value. From now on when I say "NULL is 0" I mean its value for anyone who is overly pedantic.


## Question notes

> There are some functions may not be familiar with, 
> use `man 3 functionanme` to look it up in Linux man page

- fopen, fread, rewind, fflush, strncpy, atoi

- `fwrite()`
    
    - Return value:  `fwrite()` function will return the number of objects been written.


- `rewind()`

    - The `rewind()` function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream to the beginning of the file.  It is equivalent to:`(void)fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)` except that the error indicator for the stream is also cleared (seeclearerr(3)).

    - Since rewind() does not return a value, an application wishing to detect errors should clear errno, then call rewind(), and if errno is non-zero, assume an error has occurred.

- `strncpy()`
    
    - The stpncpy() and strncpy() functions copy at most n characters from src
     into dst.  If src is less than n characters long, the remainder of dst is
     filled with `\0' characters.  Otherwise, dst is not terminated.

- `atoi()`

    - convert string to integer (equivalent to `(int)strtol(str, (char **)NULL, 10);`) 

    - Example: 
        - `atoi("20")` will return `20` which is converted from string to integer.
