#Exercise 18: Pointers To Functions

- You can create a pointer pointing to a function, too.

- The main use for this is to pass `callbacks` to other functions, or to simulate classes and objects.


## There is how a function pointer looks like:

- `int (*POINTER_NAME)(int a, int b)`

> A way to remember how to write one is to do this:
>
> - Write a normal function declaration: `int callme(int a, int b)`
>
> - Wrap function name with pointer syntax: `int (*callme)(int a, int b)`
> 
> - Change the name to the pointer name: `int (*compare_cb)(int a, int b)`

## typedef

- `typedef int (*compare_cb)(int a, int b);`
    
    - Then, `compare_cb` is just like the type `int` or `char`

    - With this, you can set something like `compare_cb callback` in the argument while setting up the prototype function.
