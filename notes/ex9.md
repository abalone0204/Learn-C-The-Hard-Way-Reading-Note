# Exercise 9: Arrays And Strings

- If we initialize an array without value, C would assign int 0 to it.

- So if u init a empty char array, every element in it should be '\0'

- `char *another = "Literal"` is more idomatic and easier way to assign a string.

> There is __no difference__ between char array and string in C
