#Exercise 13: Switch Statement

- In `switch-statement`, boolean expressions only use integer.

- If input is less than 1 argument, it won't return value 0, that tells OS that the program had an error.

```c
valueof 'A': 65
valueof 'Z': 90
valueof 'a': 97
valueof 'z': 122
```

## Extra

- If move the break into the `if-statement`, it would break from the `if-statement` and continue to the next `case`, and then display that `y is not a vowel`.
