# Structure for this repository

- `exercise`
    
    - Where I placed all of the exercise programs and makefile.

- `notes` 

    - Some tricky part or difficult things might be found there.

    - The grammar may seems rough and horrible, since I want to focus on solving problem and learning whole things from this book (Or even the skill manipulating `C` languages) first. I'll refactor it after I've done this.

- `playground`
    
    - Though this book is relatively told more details about C, however, it won't cover all of our problem(For instance, the setup of `Valgrind` drove me crazy then.). So, I frequently write some program for testing purpose, and I often found something very interesting or useful.

    - And there is where the programs I mention above.

# Rules for reading this book

- Type in all of the code. Do not copy-paste!

- Type the code in exactly, even the comments.

- Get it to run and make sure it prints the same output.

- If there are bugs fix them.

- Do the extra credit but it's alright to skip ones you can't figure out.

- Always try to figure it out first before trying to get help.
